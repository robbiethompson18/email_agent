1) whenever possible decompose, avoid repeated code, do more files rather than fewer.
2) Bare bones, as few lines of code and as little functionality as possible. Want the code to be readable.
3) Always state your plan and ask clarifying questions before writing more than one line of code. 
4) You can run any bash / shell commands you want.
