# Email Project

Automating unsubscribing from emails.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (once added)
3. Follow configuration instructions (TBD)

## Development

I need to sort out a linter


## how to use

Just forward the email you want to unsubscribe from to agent: unsubscribe. It should be able to click on links, but can't yet send unsubscribe emails.
